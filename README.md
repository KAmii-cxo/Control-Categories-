# Control Categories

# Control Categories in Cybersecurity
It refers to the classification of different types of security measures or practices designed to protect systems, networks, and data from threats.
Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

## 1. Administrative/Managerial Controls
Administrative/Managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy-based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls.

### Control Types:
- **Preventative**: Designed to prevent an incident from occurring.
- **Corrective**: Used to restore an asset after an incident.
- **Detective**: Implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress.
- **Deterrent**: Designed to discourage attacks.

#### Example of Administrative Controls:
| **Control Name**           | **Control Type** | **Control Purpose**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Least Privilege            | Preventative     | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts         |
| Disaster recovery plans    | Corrective       | Provide business continuity                                                         |
| Password policies          | Preventative     | Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attacks  |
| Access control policies    | Preventative     | Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data |
| Account management policies| Preventative     | Managing account lifecycle, reducing attack surface, and limiting impact from disgruntled employees and default account usage |
| Separation of duties       | Preventative     | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts         |

## 2. Technical Controls
Technical controls consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

#### Example of Technical Controls:
| **Control Name**               | **Control Type** | **Control Purpose**                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Firewall                        | Preventative     | To filter unwanted or malicious traffic from entering the network                         |
| IDS/IPS                         | Detective        | To detect and prevent anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule                  |
| Encryption                      | Deterrent        | Provide confidentiality to sensitive information                                          |
| Backups                         | Corrective       | Restore/recover from an event                                                              |
| Password management             | Preventative     | Reduce password fatigue                                                                   |
| Antivirus (AV) software         | Preventative     | Scans to detect and quarantine known threats                                              |
| Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention | Preventative | Necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems |

## 3. Physical/Operational Controls
Physical/Operational controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

#### Example of Physical/Operational Controls:
| **Control Name**                       | **Control Type**      | **Control Purpose**                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Time-controlled safe                   | Deterrent             | Reduce attack surface and overall impact from physical threats                            |
| Adequate lighting                      | Deterrent             | Deter threats by limiting “hiding” places                                                 |
| Closed-circuit television (CCTV)       | Preventative/Detective| Both preventative (reduces risk) and detective (provides insights post-event)             |
| Locking cabinets (for network gear)    | Preventative          | Bolster integrity by preventing unauthorized access to network gear                      |
| Signage indicating alarm service provider | Deterrent            | Deter certain types of threats by making the likelihood of a successful attack seem low    |
| Locks                                  | Deterrent/Preventative| Prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing assets                                     |
| Fire detection and prevention (alarm, sprinkler, etc.) | Detective/Preventative | Detect and prevent damage from fire to physical assets like inventory, servers, etc.      |
